- Architected a **No-Code AI Workflow Engine** featuring a drag-and-drop interface, enabling users to build dynamic, schema-driven LLM chains (Text/Image/Markdown) without writing code.
- Orchestrated a complex multi-cloud infrastructure migration **(AWS Amplify → Azure → GCP Cloud Run)**, utilizing **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** to establish a scalable, containerized CI/CD pipeline.
- Hardened platform security by implementing **RBAC and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** via AWS Cognito, later migrating to **NextAuth** to unify session management across microservices.
- Re-engineered legacy monolithic codebases into modular **RESTful microservices**, reducing API latency and cutting deployment build times by **30%**.
- Designed centralized schema handling systems that decoupled frontend logic from backend data structures, significantly improving developer velocity.
