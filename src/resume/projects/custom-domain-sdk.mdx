### **Custom Domain SDK**

A production-grade TypeScript SDK for managing custom domains using Cloudflare like Custom Hostnames. This SDK is framework-agnostic, database-agnostic, and implements a strict domain lifecycle state machine.

### **Domain Lifecycle**

The SDK enforces the following state transitions:

1. **created**: Internal record created.
2. **pending_verification**: Waiting for TXT record verification.
3. **verified**: TXT record matched.
4. **pending_dns**: Waiting for CNAME/A record to point to our edge.
5. **provisioning_ssl**: Calling Cloudflare to issue certificates.
6. **active**: Domain is live.
7. **failed**: Terminating state for any step.

### **Why this exists**
Custom domains look trivial until you try to ship them properly. DNS propagation, TLS provisioning, and provider-specific quirks make it a painful process to debug. This SDK exists to make that logic *explicit, deterministic, and reusable*.
