### **The Platform**
Nexonauts is a **dual-sided marketplace** designed to streamline the "concept-to-code" pipeline. It allows creators to sell frontend templates while enabling developers to generate instant, hosted portfolios from those assets.

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Stripe Connect Integration:** Engineered a custom payout flow using Stripe Connect, allowing automated revenue splitting between the platform and template creators.
- **Secure Asset Delivery:** Implemented signed URL generation with **AWS S3** to ensure purchased digital assets are only accessible to verified buyers.
- **Dynamic Portfolios:** Built a template engine that parses user data and injects it into pre-built React components, rendering a personalized portfolio site in sub-100ms.
