### **The Architecture**
The **College Ecosystem** is engineered as a scalable **Monorepo** using **TurboRepo**, orchestrating multiple independent applications into a cohesive digital campus experience. It solves the fragmentation of college utilities by unifying them under one authentication provider.

### **Core Engineering Features**
- **Hybrid Backend Architecture:** Utilizes **Next.js (App Router)** for the interactive frontend platform and a dedicated **Express.js/TypeScript** server for heavy computational tasks like result scraping and cron jobs.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implemented a granular permission system managing access for Admins, Faculty, Wardens, and Students. Features dynamically render based on the user's scope.
- **High-Performance Scraping:** Built a robust scraping engine to parse legacy academic result PDFs and store them in **Postgres (Drizzle ORM)**, enabling students to visualize their GPA trends over semesters.
- **Real-Time Booking:** Engineered a classroom and resource booking system using **Redis** to prevent race conditions during high-demand slots.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
- **Data:** MongoDB (User Data), Postgres (Academic Data), Redis (Caching)
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD
