### **Engineering the Pipeline**
This tool addresses the data bottleneck in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows. It is designed to navigate complex DOM structures, handle rate limits, and convert unstructured HTML into semantic JSONL datasets.

### **Features**
- **Puppeteer Clustering:** Manages a pool of headless browser instances to crawl pages concurrently without memory leaks.
- **Data Normalization:** Automatically strips non-content DOM elements (ads, navbars) to reduce token usage during LLM ingestion.
- **Resilience:** Implements exponential backoff strategies and proxy rotation to handle anti-bot measures.
